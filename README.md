# Liver-Disease-Analysis
# Domain of this Dataset
The domain of the dataset pertains to health and preventive medicine, thus documenting associations between risk factors, lifestyle issues, etc., genetic risk of chronic diseases. This domain is significant and markedly identifies the health of individuals and therefore the efficiency of healthcare systems. By analysis of the dataset, the stakeholders can comprehend actionable insights toward improvement in health outcomes, both at individual and at population levels.

# Why This Dataset Was Selected?
With several factors that may affect health outcomes, this dataset was chosen. The health determinants, which comprise lifestyle behaviours (Alcohol Consumption, Smoking), physiological metrics (BMI, Liver Function Test), and tendencies from genetic predispositions, provide a very established ground to understand the basis of chronic diseases. In addition to this, the dataset closely imitates the real-world healthcare need and thus makes for a suitable candidate toward deriving insights that would go on to inform meaningful improvements in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.

# Impact on the Future of Society
The implications of the data might go much further than the present. Predictive modelling implies that a disease could be detected long before actual signs arise, based on lifestyle and genetic indicators. This might mean predicting diabetes several years before actual symptoms appear or warning against liver problems many years before they surface. Trends can thus be identified by using these data, with future public health policies made to counter the rise of lifestyle diseases. In addressing present problems with these data, we are not just solving them, but paving the path for a future of smart, proactive, and truly personalized healthcare.

# Whether it is Supervised or Unsupervised and Why?
This project is under Supervised learning since the dataset contains mentions of the outcome, such that for each input, it is known already whether they were diagnosed with liver disease (Diagnosis=1) or not (Diagnosis=0). In supervised learning, labelled training data is used to map feature input (e.g., Age, BMI, Alcohol Consumption) into some output (like Diagnosis).
The main goal of supervised learning is to take the training data and generalize it to make accurate predictions on unseen cases. Logistic Regression falls in line with this by allowing for the learning of weights (coefficients) in front of each feature through the training stage. These weights represent how much each feature is associated with the target variable.
Whereas, unsupervised learning utilizes cases where no labelled output is available and attempts to find the latent structure or patterns in data, for example, clustering individuals. Since this is in regard to predicting our dependent variable: liver disease diagnosis, it fits well within supervised learning.

# Which Algorithm of Machine Learning is Suitable and Why?
This project will leverage the power of Logistic Regression, a robust machine learning algorithm, to predict liver disease. Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm that predicts the probability of a certain outcome belonging to a particular class. In this case, it distinguishes between "disease" (Diagnosis = 1) and "no disease" (Diagnosis = 0) for a given health parameters such as Age, BMI, Alcohol Consumption, and others. The choice is justified by the fact that Logistic Regression is the most efficient algorithm for binary classification tasks.Logistic Regression works well when there is a relatively linear relationship between the input features and the log odds of the target variable. It needs fewer resources in comparison with more complex models while giving results that can be understood via their coefficients. This will make it easier to understand how each feature contributed to the diagnosis.
